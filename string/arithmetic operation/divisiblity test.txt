ans1:
A number is divisible by 999 if sum of its 3-digit-groups 
(if required groups are formed by appending a 0s at the beginning) 
is divisible by 999.

algorithm:
A simple and efficient method is to take input in form of string
(make its length in form of 3*m by adding 0 to left of number if required) and then you
have to add the digits in blocks 
of three from right to left until it become a 3 digit number and if that result is 999 
we can say that number is divisible by 999.

As in the case of “divisibility by 9” we check that sum of all digit is divisible by 9 or not,
the same thing follows within the case of divisibility by 999. We sum up all 3-digits group from
right to left and check whether the final result is 999 or not.

// function to check divisibility
bool isDivisible999(string num)
{
    int n = num.length();
    if (n == 0 && num[0] == '0')
       return true;
 
    // Append required 0s at the beginning.
    if (n % 3 == 1)
       num = "00" + num;
    if (n % 3 == 2)
       num = "0" + num;
 
    // add digits in group of three in gSum
    int gSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i<n; i++)
    {
        // group saves 3-digit group
        int group = 0;
        group += (num[i++] - '0') * 100;
        group += (num[i++] - '0') * 10;
        group += num[i] - '0';
        gSum += group;
    }
 
    // calculate result till 3 digit sum
    if (gSum > 1000)
    {
        num = to_string(gSum);
        n = num.length();
        gSum = isDivisible999(num);
    }
    return (gSum == 999);
