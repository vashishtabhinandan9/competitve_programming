

and think of this as bubble sort
for(int i=0:i<n;i==)
for(j=0;j<n-1-i;j++)
if(a[j]>a[j+1]) then swap 

so way it work with comprator is a[j] and a[j+1] send to comprator and there we check 


bool comp(pair<int,int>p,pair<int,int>q){
    if(p.second==q.second){//second is the frequency while first is the value
    //if frequency is same then sort by value
    return p.first<q.first;//how it works
    /**
     * if (first < second) holds true then no swap else swap . so swap happens when false is returned .  
     * 
    //else if sort by freequency 
    return p.second<q.second;
    }
}


vector<pair<int,int>> v
