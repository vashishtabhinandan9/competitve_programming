Things you can add to improve the approach idea :
Since we always look for some linearity in the search space when doing binary search ,
 we realise that only [0][m-1] || [n-1][0] are such positions which can help us achieve that.
We fail to achieve it with [0][0] and [n-1][m-1] since in [0][0] all the elements to the bottom 
are also greater and so in the column, vice versa for [n-1][m-1].
Great solution btw, upvoted.


The simple idea is to remove a row or column in each comparison
 until an element is found. Start searching from the top-right corner of the matrix.
